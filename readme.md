For your script to run successfully, you'll need to install several Python packages and set up a WebDriver for Selenium. Here is a list of required packages and instructions for the README file:

---

**Required Packages:**
1. `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
2. `selenium`: A tool for automating web browsers.

**WebDriver Setup:**
- The script uses Chrome WebDriver. You must download and install ChromeDriver compatible with the version of the Chrome browser installed on your system. The ChromeDriver should be placed in a directory that is in the system's PATH.

**Installation Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.
2. Install required Python packages. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas selenium
   ```

3. Download ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
   - Choose the version that matches your Chrome browser version.
   - Extract the downloaded file and place `chromedriver` in a location on your system PATH, or update your script to include the path to `chromedriver`.

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Place your CSV file in the same directory as the script or provide the absolute path to the CSV file in the script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script with Python:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

**Notes:**
- Modify the `index` in the line `if index >= 466:` to the number of rows you wish to process in your CSV file.
- Update the `csv_file_path` variable with the path to your CSV file if it's not in the same directory as the script.

Remember to replace `"main.py"` with the actual name of your script file if it's different. Also, ensure that your users have Python 3 installed and know how to navigate the command line or terminal.
